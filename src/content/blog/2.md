- I use `stow`, `git`,`systemd`
### Stow
- `stow` simplifies managing configuration files by creating symbolic links.
-  make a parent directory that will contain all configs
- create subfolders within your `~/dotfiles` directory, with each subfolder holding the configuration for a specific program (e.g., `~/dotfiles/nvim`)
- `Stow` creates symbolic links (shortcuts, essentially) from the files inside that subfolder to where your system or applications expect them to be in your actual home directory.
- So, if you have `~/dotfiles/bash/.bashrc`, Stow will create a symlink at `~/.bashrc` that points back to the original file in your `~/dotfiles` directory.
- So, `~/dotfiles/vim/.config/nvim/`, will create symlink at `~/.config/nvim/`
```bash
sudo pacman -S stow
mkdir ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
mkdir -p vim/.config/nvim/init.lua
stow nvim
ls ~/.config/nvim #confirm that a symlink was generated
```
### Git
- init a `git` repo and connect it to  `github`
```bash
git init
git remote add origin YOUR_REMOTE_URL
```
### push script
- make a push script using bash
- `~/dotfiles/push_script.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Assuming your dotfiles repo is at ~/dotfiles

cd $HOME/dotfiles # Or wherever your dotfiles repo is
git add . # Add any new or changed files
git commit -m "Auto-commit dotfiles changes $(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)" || true # Commit only if changes exist
git push
```
- Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x push_script.sh
```
### systemd
- Systemd operates on the principle of "units," and each unit type (like a service, timer, socket, etc.) has its own dedicated file extension and purpose.
	- A `.service` file describes what to run (e.g., a script, an application).
	- A `.timer` file describes when to run a corresponding service.
	
- Create a service file (`~/.config/systemd/user/dotfiles-push.service`)
```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Push dotfiles to GitHub

[Service]
Type = oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "~/dotfiles/push_script.sh"
# Ensure HOME is set correctly for your script
Environment=HOME=%h
```
- Create a timer file (`~/.config/systemd/user/dotfiles-push.timer`)
```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Run dotfiles push service hourly

[Timer]
OnCalendar=hourly
Persistent=true
# This line links the timer to the service:
Unit=dotfiles-push.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```
- Reload systemd, enable, and start the timer:
```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable dotfiles-push.timer
systemctl --user start dotfiles-push.timer
```
- check the status
```bash
systemctl --user status dotfiles-push.timer
journalctl --user -u dotfiles-push.service
```
